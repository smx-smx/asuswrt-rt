Introduction
************

Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server.  That means that unlike
traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming connection,
nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple connections.
It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections, and
forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate processes),
automatic directory generation, and automatic file gunzipping.
Preliminary tests show Boa is capable of handling several thousand hits
per second on a 300 MHz Pentium and dozens of hits per second on a
lowly 20 MHz 386/SX.

The primary design goals of Boa are speed and security.  Security, in
the sense of _can't be subverted by a malicious user,_ not _fine
grained access control and encrypted communications_.  Boa is not
intended as a feature-packed server; if you want one of those, check out
WN (`http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/') from John Franks.  Modifications to
Boa that improve its speed, security, robustness, and portability, are
eagerly sought.  Other features may be added if they can be achieved
without hurting the primary goals.

Boa was created in 1991 by Paul Phillips (<psp@well.com>).  It is now
being maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle (<ldoolitt@boa.org>)
and Jon Nelson (<jnelson@boa.org>).  Please see the acknowledgement
section for further details.

GNU/Linux is the development platform at the moment, other OS's are
known to work.  If you'd like to contribute to this effort, contact
Larry or Jon via e-mail.

Installation and Usage
**********************

Boa is currently being developed and tested on GNU/Linux/i386.  The
code is straightforward (more so than most other servers), so it should
run easily on most modern Unix-alike platforms.  Recent versions of Boa
worked fine on FreeBSD, SunOS 4.1.4, GNU/Linux-SPARC, and HP-UX 9.0.
Pre-1.2.0 GNU/Linux kernels may not work because of deficient mmap()
implementations.

Installation
============

  1. Unpack
       1. Choose, and cd into, a convenient directory for the package.

       2. `tar -xvzf boa-0.94.tar.gz', or for those of you with an
          archaic (non-GNU) tar; `gzip -cd &lt; boa-0.94.tar.gz | tar
          -xvf -'

       3. Read the documentation.  Really.


  2. Build
       1. cd into the src directory.

       2. (optional) Change the default SERVER_ROOT by setting the
          #define     at the top of src/defines.h

       3. Type `./configure; make'

       4. Report any errors to the maintainers for resolution, or strike
             out on your own.


  3. Configure
       1. Choose a user and server port under which Boa can run.  The
           traditional port is 80, and user nobody (create if     you
          need to) is often a good selection for security purposes.
          If you don't have (or choose not to use) root privileges, you
             can not use port numbers less than 1024, nor can you
          switch user id.

       2. Choose a server root.  The conf directory within the
          server root must hold your copy of the configuration file
          _boa.conf_

       3. Choose locations for log files, CGI programs (if any), and
          the base of your URL tree.

       4. Set the location of the mime.types file.

       5. Edit _conf/boa.conf_ according to your     choices above
          (this file documents itself).  Read through this file     to
          see what other features you can configure.


  4. Start
        * Start Boa.  If you didn't build the right SERVER_ROOT into the
             binary, you can specify it on the command line with the
          -c option     (command line takes precedence).
                               Example: ./boa -c /usr/local/boa


  5. Test
        * At this point the server should run and serve documents.
          If not, check the error_log file for clues.

  6. Install
        * Copy the binary to a safe place, and put the invocation into
            your system startup scripts.  Use the same -c option you
          used     in your initial tests.

Files Used by Boa
=================

`boa.conf'
       This file is the sole configuration file for Boa. The directives
     in this   file are defined in the DIRECTIVES section.

`mime.types'
       The MimeTypes <filename> defines what Content-Type Boa will   send
     in an HTTP/1.0 or better transaction.    Set to /dev/null if you
     do not want to load a mime types file.    Do *not* comment out
     (better use AddType!)

Compile-Time and Command-Line Options
=====================================

SERVER_ROOT
-C
      The default server root as #defined by SERVER_ROOT in  `defines.h'
     can be overridden on the commandline using the  `-c' option.  The
     server root must hold your local copy of the  configuration file
     `boa.conf'.
            Example: /usr/sbin/boa -c /etc/boa

boa.conf Directives
===================

The Boa configuration file is parsed with a lex/yacc or flex/bison
generated parser. If it reports an error, the line number will be
provided; it should be easy to spot. The syntax of each of these rules
is very simple, and they can occur in any order. Where possible, these
directives mimic those of NCSA httpd 1.3; I (Paul Phillips) saw no
reason to introduce gratuitous differences.

Note: the "ServerRoot" is not in this configuration file. It can be
compiled into the server (see `defines.h') or specified on the command
line with the `-c' option.

The following directives are contained in the `boa.conf' file, and most,
but not all, are required.

`Port <Integer>'
       This is the port that Boa runs on. The default port for http
     servers is 80.    If it is less than 1024, the server must be
     started as root.

`Listen <IP>'
       The Internet address to bind(2) to, in quadded-octet form
     (numbers).    If you leave it out, it binds to all addresses
     (INADDR_ANY).

       The name you provide gets run through inet_aton(3), so you have to
      use dotted  quad notation.  This configuration is too important
     to trust some DNS.

       You only get one "Listen" directive,  if you want service on
     multiple   IP addresses, you have three choices:

       1. Run boa without a "Listen" directive:
             * All addresses are treated the same; makes sense if the
               addresses      are localhost, ppp, and eth0.

             * Use the VirtualHost directive below to point requests to
               different files.       Should be good for a very large
               number of addresses (web hosting clients).


       2. Run one copy of boa per IP address:
             * Each instance has its own configuration with its own
               "Listen" directive.  No big deal up to a few tens of
               addresses. Nice separation      between clients.


`User <username or UID>'
      The name or UID the server should run as. For Boa to attempt this,
     the  server must be started as root.

`Group <groupname or GID>'
      The group name or GID the server should run as. For Boa to attempt
     this,  the server must be started as root.

`ServerAdmin <email address>'
      The email address where server problems should be sent. Note: this
     is not  currently used.

`ErrorLog <filename>'
      The location of the error log file. If this does not start with /,
     it is  considered relative to the server root. Set to /dev/null if
     you don't want  errors logged.

`AccessLog <filename>'
      The location of the access log file. If this does not start with
     /, it is  considered relative to the server root. Comment out or
     set to /dev/null  (less effective) to disable access logging.

`VerboseCGILogs'
      This is a logical switch and does not take any parameters. Comment
     out to  disable. All it does is switch on or off logging of when
     CGIs are launched and when  the children return.

`CgiLog <filename>'
      The location of the CGI error log file.  If  specified, this is
     the file that the stderr of CGIs is tied to.  Otherwise, writes
     to stderr meet the bit bucket.

`ServerName <server_name>'
      The name of this server that should be sent back to clients if
     different  than that returned by gethostname.

`VirtualHost'
      This is a logical switch and does not take any parameters.
     Comment out to disable. Given  DocumentRoot /var/www, requests on
     interface `A' or  IP `IP-A' become /var/www/IP-A. Example:
     http://localhost/ becomes  /var/www/127.0.0.1

`DocumentRoot <directory>'
      The root directory of the HTML documents. If this does not start
     with /,  it is considered relative to the server root.

`UserDir <directory>'
      The name of the directory which is appended onto a user's home
     directory  if a ~user request is received.

`DirectoryIndex <filename>'
      Name of the file to use as a pre-written HTML directory index.
     Please  make and use these files. On the fly creation of directory
     indexes  can be slow.

`DirectoryMaker <full pathname to program>'
      Name of the program used  to generate on-the-fly directory
     listings.  The program must take one or two  command-line
     arguments, the first being the directory to index (absolute), and
     the  second, which is  optional, should be the "title" of the
     document be. Comment out if  you don't  want on the fly directory
     listings. If this  does not start with /, it is  considered
     relative to the server root.

`DirectoryCache <directory>'
      DirectoryCache: If DirectoryIndex doesn't exist, and
     DirectoryMaker has been  commented out, the the on-the-fly
     indexing of Boa can be used  to generate indexes  of directories.
     Be warned that the output is extremely minimal and can cause
     delays when slow disks are used.  Note: The DirectoryCache must be
     writable by the  same user/group that Boa runs as.

`KeepAliveMax <integer>'
      Number of KeepAlive requests to allow per connection. Comment out,
     or set  to 0 to disable keepalive processing.

`KeepAliveTimeout <integer>'
      Number of seconds to wait before keepalive connections time out.

`MimeTypes <file>'
      The location of the mime.types file. If this does not start with
     /, it is  considered relative to the server root.   Comment out to
     avoid loading mime.types (better use AddType!)

`DefaultType <mime type>'
      MIME type used if the file extension is unknown, or there is no
     file  extension.

`AddType <mime type> <extension> extension...'
      Associates a MIME type  with an extension or extensions.

`Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias'
      Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias all have the same semantics -
     they match the beginning of a request and take appropriate action.
     Use Redirect for other servers, Alias for the same server, and
     ScriptAlias to enable directories for script execution.

`Redirect <path1> <path2>'
       allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist
     in your server's namespace, but do not anymore. This allows you
     tell the clients where to look for the relocated document.

`Alias <path1> <path2>'
       aliases one path to another. Of course, symbolic links in the
     file system work fine too.

`ScriptAlias <path1> <path2>'
       maps a virtual path to a directory for serving scripts.

Security
========

Boa has been designed to use the existing file system security.   In
`boa.conf', the directives _user_ and _group_ determine who Boa will
run as, if launched by root.  By default, the user/group is
nobody/nogroup.  This allows quite a bit of flexibility.  For example,
if you want to disallow access to otherwise accessible directories or
files, simply make them inaccessible to nobody/nogroup. If the user
that Boa runs as is "boa" and the groups that "boa" belongs to include
"web-stuff" then files/directories accessible by users with group
"web-stuff" will also be accessible to Boa.

The February 2000 hoo-rah from CERT advisory CA-2000-02
(http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html) has little to do with
Boa.  As of version 0.94.4, Boa's escaping rules have been cleaned up a
little, but they weren't that bad before.  The example CGI programs
have been updated to show what effort is needed there.  If you write,
maintain, or use CGI programs under Boa (or any other server) it's
worth your while to read and understand this advisory.  The real
problem, however, boils down to browser and web page designers
emphasizing frills over content and security.  The market leading
browsers assume (incorrectly) that all web pages are trustworthy.

Limits and Design Philosophy
****************************

There are many issues that become more difficult to resolve in a single
tasking web server than in the normal forking model.  Here is a partial
list - there are probably others that haven't been encountered yet.

Limits
======

   * Slow file systems

      The file systems being served should be much faster than the
     network connection to the HTTP requests, or performance will
     suffer.   For instance, if a document is served from a CD-ROM, the
     whole server  (including all other currently incomplete data
     transfers) will stall  while the CD-ROM spins up.  This is a
     consequence of the fact that Boa  mmap()'s each file being served,
     and lets the kernel read and cache  pages as best it knows how.
     When the files come from a local disk  (the faster the better),
     this is no problem, and in fact delivers  nearly ideal performance
     under heavy load.  Avoid serving documents  from NFS and CD-ROM
     unless you have even slower inbound net  connections (e.g., POTS
     SLIP).

   * DNS lookups

      Writing a nonblocking gethostbyaddr is a difficult and not very
     enjoyable task.  Paul Phillips experimented with several methods,
     including a separate logging process, before removing hostname
     lookups entirely. There is a companion program with Boa
     `util/resolver.pl' that will postprocess the logfiles and  replace
     IP addresses with hostnames, which is much faster no matter  what
     sort of server you run.

   * Identd lookups

      Same difficulties as hostname lookups; not included.   Boa
     provides a REMOTE_PORT environment variable, in addition  to
     REMOTE_ADDR, so that a CGI program can do its own ident.   See the
     end of examples/cgi-test.cgi.

   * Password file lookups via NIS

      If users are allowed to serve HTML from their home directories,
     password file lookups can potentially block the process.  To lessen
     the impact, each user's home directory is cached by Boa so it need
     only be looked up once.

   * Running out of file descriptors

      Since a file descriptor is needed for every ongoing connection
     (two for non-nph CGIs, directories, and automatic gunzipping of
     files),  it is possible though highly improbable to run out of file
     descriptors.  The symptoms of this conditions may vary with  your
     particular unix variant, but you will probably see log  entries
     giving an error message for accept.   Try to build your kernel to
     give an adequate number for  your usage - GNU/Linux provides 256
     out of the box, more than  enough for most people.

Differences between Boa and other web servers
=============================================

In the pursuit of speed and simplicity, some aspects of Boa differ from
the popular web servers.  In no particular order:

   * REMOTE_HOST environment variable not set for CGI programs

       The REMOTE_HOST environment variable is not set for CGI programs,
     for reasons already described.  This is easily worked around
     because the   IP address is provided in the REMOTE_HOST variable,
     so (if the CGI   program actually cares) gethostbyaddr or a
     variant can be used.

   * There are no server side includes (SSI) in Boa

       We don't like them, and they are too slow to parse.  We will
     consider   more efficient alternatives.

   * There are no access control features

       Boa will follow symbolic links, and serve any file that it can
     read.  The expectation is that you will configure Boa to run as
     user   "nobody", and only files configured world readable will come
      out.

   * No chroot option

       There is no option to run chrooted.  If anybody wants this, and is
      willing to try out experimental code, contact the maintainers.

Unexpected Behavior
===================

   * SIGHUP handling

      Like any good server, Boa traps SIGHUP and rereads `boa.conf'.
     However, under normal circumstances, it has already given away
     permissions, so many items listed in `boa.conf' can not take
     effect.   No attempt is made to change uid, gid, log files, or
     server port.   All other configuration changes should take place
     smoothly.

   * Relative URL handling

      Not all browsers handle relative URLs correctly.  Boa will not
     cover up for this browser bug, and will typically report 404 Not
     Found  for URL's containing odd combinations of "../" 's.

      Note: As of version 0.95.0 (unreleased) the URL parser has been
     rewritten and *does* correctly handle relative URLs.
