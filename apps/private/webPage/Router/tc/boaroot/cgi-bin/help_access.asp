        UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a distributed, open networking standard that uses TCP/IP for simple 
        peer-to-peer network connectivity between devices. A UPnP device can dynamically join a network, 
        obtain an IP address, convey its capabilities and learn about other devices on the network. 
      
      
        In turn, a device can leave a network smoothly and automatically when it is no longer in use.  
        UPnP broadcasts are only allowed on the LAN.<br>
        <b><i>Auto-Configure</i></b>&nbsp;
      
      
        UPnP network devices can automatically configure network addressing, announce their presence 
        in the network to other UPnP devices and enable exchange of simple product and service descriptions.

        The Dynamic Domain Name System lets you use a static host name with a dynamic IP address. 
        User should type the host name, user name and password assigned to your ADSL Router by your 
        Dynamic DNS provider. User also can decide to turn on DYNDNS Wildcard or not.
