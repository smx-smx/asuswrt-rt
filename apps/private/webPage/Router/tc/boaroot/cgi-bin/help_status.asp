         The ADSL Router keeps statistic of traffic that passes through it. You are able to view 
         the amount of packets that passes through the Router on both the WAN port and the LAN port. 
      
      
         The traffic counter will reset if the device is rebooted.
         You can select Ethernet/ADSL to view the statistics report of LAN/WAN.

        <b><i>ADSL Firmware Version</i></b>&nbsp;
        This field displays the ADSL data pump firmware version number.<br>
        <b><i>Line State</i></b>&nbsp;
        This field displays the ADSL connection process and status.<br>
      
        
        <b><i>Modulation</i></b>&nbsp;
        This field displays the ADSL modulation status for G.dmt or T1.413.<br>

        <b><i>Max Tx Power</i></b>&nbsp;
        This field displays the transmit output power level of the ADSL Router.<br>
        <b><i>SNR Margin</i></b>&nbsp;
        Amount of increased noise that can be tolerated while maintaining the designed BER (bit error rate). 
      
      
        The SNR Margin is set by Central Office DSLAM. If the SNR Margin is increased, 
        bit error rate performance will improve, but the data rate will decrease. Conversely, 
        if the SNR Margin is decreased, bit error rate performance will decrease, but the data rate will increase.<br>
        <b><i>Line Attenuation</i></b>&nbsp;
      
      
        Attenuation is the decrease in magnitude of the ADSL line signal between the transmitter 
        (Central Office DSLAM) and the receiver (Client ADSL Modem), measured in dB. It is measured 
        by calculating the difference in dB between the signal power level received at the Client ADSL Router
        and the reference signal power level transmitted from the Central Office DSLAM. <br>
      
      
        <b><i>Data Rate</i></b>&nbsp;
        This field displays the ADSL data rate.
